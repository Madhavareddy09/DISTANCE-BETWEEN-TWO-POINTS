# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 
Import math module.
### Step 2: 
Give the two co-ordinates for finding distance.
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.JPG)
### Step 4: 
Use the in-built sqrt function to find the distance.
### Step 5: 
Print the value of distance.
### PROGRAM:

#Program to find the distance between two points.
#Developed by: KAMIREDDY MADHAVA REDDY
#RegisterNumber: 23009929
import math
l1 = [10,6]
l2 = [4,2]
distance = math.sqrt((((l2[0]-l1[0])**2)+((l2[1]-l1[1]))**2))
print("{:.2f}".format(distance))



### OUTPUT:

### RESULT:
Thus the program to find the distance between two points executedÂ successfully.
